          <p>The Kind Bean Tour is a project that showcases the “kindest” cafes of Aarhus regarding their values towards animals and the planet. Main bean of the show today is Café Mellemfolk. I mean, how could they not be? It is much more than just a vegan café. They have everything you need: Food, coffee, good atmosphere but also interesting events and they are a non-profit, volunteer-run cafe. Which is a part of Mellemfolkeligt Samvirke/ActionAid - an NGO that helps people in need. A business worth supporting, no doubt here.</p>

                    <p><b>Coffee</b><br>
                        It’s not a café without a coffee so let’s start with that. I’ve had their Fair Trade coffee (mostly latte) there many times and it is fairly good. One thing I noticed is that the taste is not very consistent. It is decent most of the time but it happens that something can be a bit off. I believe the reason for that could be high turnover of volunteers that work there. So sometimes your coffee will be made by a “newbie”. Personally, I can totally live with that! I give them 3/5 kind beans.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="food-text">
                    <p><b>Food</b><br>
                        Probably one that everyone is exited for the most. Or is it just me? Well I have a good reason because food there is great! I have tried many things on both lunch and evening menu and I have been to many Global Kitchens they hosted and in my opinion they have the most thoughtful and delicious and affordable vegan food in Aarhus. I recommend “caramelised onion panini” before 17 and “mushroom ramen” after 17. 
                        I have to give them 5/5 kind beans!</p>

                        <p><b>Atmosphere</b><br>
                            Sometimes we just come looking for coffee but atmosphere is what can impress us the most. Café Mellemfolk is a spacious yet cozy cafe with a vintage look, recycled furniture, and warm lighting. It's a popular spot for socialising and studying, and they host various events like quizzes and concerts and many more things are happening all the time. Just check their Facebook! They deserve 5/5 kind beans.</p>

                    <div class="location-text">
                        <p><b>Location</b><br>
                            The café is located in the heart of Aarhus - The Latin Quarter. It’s full of cozy small streets, old building and cobblestone. That’s also where all the restaurants and bars live. It is very central but don’t miss it, because cafe is hiding in a yard on Mejlgade 53. It couldn’t be better! 5/5 beans.

                        <p><b>Kindness</b><br>
                            How without a kindness scale to make sure we actually want to give them our money? In this case the kindness is off the charts. Non-profit, volunteer run cafe that is run by ActionAid Denmark, which is an NGO that fights discrimination, climate crisis, inequality and poverty. Their coffee is Fair Trade, their food is vegan, they often host events regarding a variety of social issues, do we need to know anymore? If you do, check their socials because I could keep going forever.
                            I’m sorry but that’s gonna be 6/5 kind beans because like I said kindness is off the charts with this one!</p>

                        <p><b>Summary</b><br>
                            So all in all I’m very impressed and I definitely recommend it to vegans and other compassionate people. One more thing I think is worth mentioning is that they host a lot of events that support local minorities and community in general if that’s something you are interested in. An example for that would be their Queer book club or Craft Tuesday where all the creative souls can do dyi projects in each other company. But they have something for everyone! So I feel like I have to bring in one more rating category just this once.

            <h2>CAFE PLAYLIST</h2>
            <p>Here is a little something for all my melophiles out there. I created a playlist on Spotify with a purpose of reflecting cafe’s general atmosphere and I chose one song that I would call their “vibe”, so you can get a feel for it through the music.<br><br>

            And if you have ever visited them and you liked it, you can now also add songs you deem worthy! So we can all together edit a playlist and listen to it. And don’t be shy. I’m very exited to see what others will add to the list!</p>
